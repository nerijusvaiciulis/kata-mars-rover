Mars Rover Kata
===============

# DONE
- Rover is initialised with its current coordinates and the direction it is facing.
- These could be any coordinates, supplied as arguments (x, y, direction) e.g. (4, 2, EAST).



# Problem Description















## Part I
The rover is given a command string which contains multiple commands. This string must then be
broken into each individual command and that command then executed. Implement the following
commands:
- F -> Move forward on current heading
- B -> Move backwards on current heading
- L -> Rotate left by 90 degrees
- R -> Rotate right by 90 degrees
An example command might be FLFFFRFLB
- Once the full command string has been followed, 
  the rover reports it's current coordinates and heading in the format (6, 4) NORTH
